# NOSE
Simulation and applications code for NOSE


### Simulations
1. Run the R file "Genxxx.R " (e.g. "Gen7CP.R" in S1) to generate simulated data. 

2. Run the R file "Simxxx.R" (e.g. "Sim7CPMean.R" in S1) to conduct simulations. 

### Remarks 

Implementation of NOSE under 5 scenarios are contained by 4 R files "NOSE_CPMean.R", "NOSE_CPScale.R",  "NOSE_CPPois.R", and "NOSE_CPLinear.R", respectively. (Scenarios 4 and 5 have the same implementation). 

In each simulation and application setting, load the corresponding R file first.
